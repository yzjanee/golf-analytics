AI-driven golf performance analysis (PGA Tour 2015–2022) — Colab notebook, models, and SHAP interpretability

**Author:** Yuanzhen (Jane) Wei  

This project uses PGA Tour data (2015–2022) to predict round-level golf performance using machine learning (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and interpret results with SHAP.

**Main file:** `ai_golf_performance_analysis.ipynb`  
**Goal:** Identify which metrics (e.g., strokes-gained, putting, driving) most affect total strokes per round.

**How to view:**  
- Open the notebook directly on GitHub, or  
- Download it and open in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

**Next steps:**  
- Extend analysis with additional seasons or player-level features  
- Compare results with amateur/junior datasets  
- Publish as a high-school research project
